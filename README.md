# react_conditional_rendering_login_form
A basic Log In form Created with CodeSandbox

## Description

A form that will render "Hello" if the user is Logged In, otherwise,     
it will render a Log In Form (Username, Password & Submit Button) so the user can Log In.

## What I have learned with this project

* Use components and props.
* Render componenets depeding of certain condition (if statement) .
* Use TERNARY OPERATOR
    * Two options depending if the condition is true or false
    * Render component if condition true. Nothing at all (null) if false 
* && in JS 
    * Condition && Expression:
    * true && Expression
    * false && Expression-Not-Evaluated
