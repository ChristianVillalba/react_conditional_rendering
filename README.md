## Notes 

### Conditional Rendering
Techniques to show different React Components depending on some sort of condition.

Eg: creating a [Login Flow:](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/react_conditional_rendering_login_form.git)          
Different components depending on whether the user was logged in or if they were logged out.         
We can extract the components so they can be reused.       
Each component should have a single responsibility.       


## What I have learned with this project

* Use components and props.
* Render componenets depeding of certain condition (if statement) .
* Use TERNARY OPERATOR
    * Two options depending if the condition is true or false
    * Render component if condition true. Nothing at all (null) if false 
* && in JS 
    * Condition && Expression:
    * true && Expression
    * false && Expression-Not-Evaluated
